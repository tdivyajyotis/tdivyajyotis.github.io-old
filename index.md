# Hello, World! 
## Who am I?
My name is **Tripathy Divyajyoti Senapati**. I am currently a student from Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. I code in my spare time and attend CTF's often. My socials are Lucas42#0815 on [Discord](https://discord.com), [tdivyajyotis](https://github.com/tdivyajyotis) on Github and [repl.it](https://repl.it/@tdivyajyotis), [Linux_CryptoMC](https://reddit.com/user/Linux_CryptoMC) on Reddit, [codercuber](https://twitter.com/codercuber) on Twitter, [dev.to](https://dev.to/codercuber) and CTFtime.
## What are my skills?
I have experience with Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, Python, AI/ML, Git, HTML5, CSS3, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), [Astro](https://astro.build), Javascript and Typescript, Node.js, Markdown, Arduino and Linux. I have also frequently used many CTF tools like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), Firefox and Chrome DevTools, etc. and Linux CLI utilities like binwalk, xxd etc. I also use [repl.it](https://repl.it) as a quick IDE and runtime for short tasks, experimentation, and for testing out potentially malicious code. I use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) for AI/ML testing. I post my CTF writeups on my [dev.to blog](https://dev.to/codercuber). I have also made some Minecraft mods with [MCreator](https://mcreator.net). Did I mention; I am a Minecraft player too ;)
## What is this site for?
I mostly use this site as a portfolio and for hosting static sites that I make.
### Hit me up on Discord for anything about computers :)
# HAX!
