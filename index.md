# Hello, World! 

I'm **Tripathy Divyajyoti Senapati**.

I'm currently a student from Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.

I'm passionate about Bioinformatics, Material Science and Chemistry. I'm an avid quizzer too!


## Where can you find me?
I'm on almost all of the social networks, going by tdivyajyotis;
but notably on Reddit & Twitter, I go by my pseudonym codercuber instead.

Feel free to email at tdivyajyotis[at]duck.com .
