# Hello World! 
## Who am I?
My name is **Tripathy Divyajyoti Senapati**. I am currently a student from Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. I code in my spare time and attend CTF's often. My socials are Lucas42#0815 on Discord, tdivyajyotis on Github, Linux_CryptoMC on Reddit, codercuber on Twitter, dev.to and CTFtime.
## What are my skills?
I have experience with VSCode, Python, AI/ML, Git, Jekyll, Astro, Javascript and Typescript, Node.js, Arduino and Linux. I have also frequently used many CTF tools like Burp Suite, Firefox and Chrome DevTools, etc. and Linux CLI utilities like binwalk, xxd etc. I also use repl.it as a quick IDE and runtime for short tasks, experimenting, and for testing out potentially malicious code. I use Google Colaboratory for AI/ML testing. I post my CTF writeups on my dev.to blog
## What is this site for?
I mostly use this site as a portfolio and for hosting static sites that I make.

### Hit me up on Discord for anything about computers : )
