# Hello, World! 

I'm **Tripathy Divyajyoti Senapati**.

I'm currently a student from Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India.

I code out of curiosity and practice it as a hobby too!

## What do I code?
I frequently use Python for most projects, but JS is also a nice language for webapps n stuff.
I also use C++ for competitive programming.
VS Code's the main IDE for everything & Code::Blocks for competitive programming

## Where can you find me?
I'm on almost all of the social networks, going by tdivyajyotis;
but notably on Reddit & Twitter, I go by my pseudonym codercuber instead.

anyways the most reliable option is good ol' email at codercuber[at]pm.me or tdivyajyotis[at]duck.com
